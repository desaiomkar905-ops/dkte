/**
 * CivicShield AI seed.
 * Creates departments, a minimal set of staff users (assignment targets for
 * the dashboards), and a handful of DEMO complaints (source: "DEMO", always
 * labeled in the UI) so the dashboard/map are not empty during the demo.
 *
 * Authentication is Google/Firebase-only: NO login credentials are seeded or
 * printed. Staff accounts here exist only as assignment targets and are
 * claimed automatically when a real Google account with a matching
 * STAFF_EMAILS entry signs in for the first time. Citizen sign-ups happen
 * exclusively through Google sign-in.
